- **Access archived data**: Toggle "Show Archived" on the Leagues page to view past seasons
- **Restore anytime**: Unarchive a league to make it active again
- **Use case**: Archive a "Winter 2024" league when the season ends, then create a new "Spring 2025" league

Each league represents a season of play. To track multiple seasons, create separate leagues (e.g., "Winter League 2024", "Winter League 2025").
